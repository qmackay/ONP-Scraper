This scraper is only set up for Olympic National Park - Wilderness Permits. It should work for anything, but will require manual tweaking. I run it on Google Colab at 2 minute intervals. Can also run locally with a few modifications.

This is one of my first ever projects - I only code out of necessity! Don't make fun of it!

Important Things:

The code stops running if there is a successful permit found, so it doesn't spam you with emails.
It currently does not support multiple dates, although I may update it with that capability soon.
YMMV with different permits outside of the one hardcoded, as they may use a different structure and you may need to look closely at the source.
