This scraper is only set up for Olympic National Park - Wilderness Permits and Mt Rainier Wilderness Permits.

The structure is here, so with a bit of know-how you could probably get it to work with most permits (I have had problems with Yosemite, though).

This is one of my first ever projects - I only code out of necessity! Don't make fun of it!

Important Things:

1. The code stops running if there is a successful permit found, so it doesn't spam you with emails.
2. It currently does not support multiple dates, although I may update it with that capability soon.
3. YMMV with different permits outside of the one hardcoded, as they may use a different structure and you may need to look closely at the source.
